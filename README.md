# Nmrih-Junkyard
Welcome to the junkyard of my Nmrih Custom Content. Here you can find all my (ongoing) projects. I have decided to step down and focus on myself and my mental health.
After many hard years for me, i've finally decided to part ways with everything this community ever had to offer. I should have probably stepped down like 5 / 6 years ago, but i kept on going, i no longer identify with this game and i sorely despise anything that Torn Banner has done to this franchise. I may have not been so nice to some people, but in all truth i always loved this game from the bottom of my heart. People can find all my projects here. Please don't contact me and don't try to poke me about this, i genuinely no longer wish to be identified to anything vaguely related to this game. Thanks in advance and please respect my boundaries, cheers and yours truthfully Fersigal
